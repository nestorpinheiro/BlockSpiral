MATHEMATICAL CALCULATIONS USING SPIRALS THAT MAY BRING A SECURITY RISK TO RSA ENCRYPTION.

I'm not very familiar with Github, so I don't know if what I'm doing is correct. I'm posting a link to a thesis (Paper) I wrote, where I present mathematical calculations using spirals to sequence prime numbers, which could pose a risk of breaking RSA encryption, which is widely used in data transfer and storage. I also propose a relatively simple solution. Paper: http://blockspiral.blogspot.com/
